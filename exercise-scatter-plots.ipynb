You can reference the tutorial at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/scatter-plots).**\n# \n# ---\n# \n\n# %% [markdown]\n# In this exercise, you will use your new knowledge to propose a solution to a real-world scenario.  To succeed, you will need to import data into Python, answer questions using the data, and generate **scatter plots** to understand patterns in the data.\n# \n# ## Scenario\n# \n# You work for a major candy producer, and your goal is to write a report that your company can use to guide the design of its next product.  Soon after starting your research, you stumble across this [very interesting dataset](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) containing results from a fun survey to crowdsource favorite candies.\n# \n# ## Setup\n# \n# Run the next cell to import and configure the Python libraries that you need to complete the exercise.\n\n# %% [code]\nimport pandas as pd\npd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nprint(\"Setup Complete\")\n\n# %% [markdown]\n# The questions below will give you feedback on your work.

There are 13 columns:\n# - `'competitorname'` contains the name of the candy bar. \n# - the next **9** columns (from `'chocolate'` to `'pluribus'`) describe the candy.  For instance, rows with chocolate candies have `\"Yes\"` in the `'chocolate'` column (and candies without chocolate have `\"No\"` in the same column).\n# - `'sugarpercent'` provides some indication of the amount of sugar, where higher values signify higher sugar content.\n# - `'pricepercent'` shows the price per unit, relative to the other candies in the dataset.\n# - `'winpercent'` is calculated from the survey results; higher values indicate that the candy was more popular with survey respondents.\n# \n# Use the first five rows of the data to answer the questions below.\n\n# %% [code]\n# Fill in the line below: Which candy was more popular with survey respondents:\n# '3 Musketeers' or 'Almond Joy'?
